//! SQLite-backed event journal. Owns the sequence-allocation law:
//!
//! - `seq` is per-session, starts at 1, and is allocated only at commit time
//!   as `MAX(seq) + 1` inside an IMMEDIATE transaction, so committed
//!   sequences are monotonic and gap-free even across processes.
//! - An envelope is TRUE only once [`EventStore::append`] returns. Publishing
//!   committed envelopes to live subscribers is the caller's duty.
//! - The `envelope_json` column is the authoritative byte-for-byte record;
//!   the `seq` / `event_id` / `committed_at_ms` columns are denormalized
//!   copies for indexing, cross-checked against the JSON on every read.
//! - `worker_generation` is profile-owned and advances once per successful
//!   open while the exclusive profile lock is held, fencing actor identities
//!   across process restarts even when the wall clock repeats.
