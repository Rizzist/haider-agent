# Wave 973 merge resolution

The round 9 merge integrates `a8b218079422dd0a70c6997a56fc6a4f5d4b051f` into the terminal UI lane based on `a97534c62a6005545df9796db68a475a14fc9ffd`.

In `session::chip_apply`, the envelope remains authoritative for the event timestamp and activity provenance, including replay, background and parked branch routes. The lane's question creation and matching answer/close updates remain before transcript reduction, so the previous open menu can still be matched. Neither side's behavior is discarded.

The keyboard input tests now construct real child envelopes instead of passing bare timestamps to the changed API. The baseline was re-derived as **6,950 tests** with `cargo run --locked -p xtask -- test-count --update` on the resolved tree. It is checked again on the committed merged candidate.

Round 9 also repairs visible child question input ownership, retires old keyboard input after accepted external editor writes, carries remote connection attempt identity through request/reply mapping and keyboard input handling, and conditions paste-specific decoder tests on the paste feature. The pre-existing overlay text observation F4 is deferred to lane 974 as instructed.
